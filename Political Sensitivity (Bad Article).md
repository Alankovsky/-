### Political Sensitivity

*This article sucks. It's hollow. I don't suggest reading*

*Maybe i have to include some furthur analysis, in lens such as social-psychology*

Political sensitive topics here are not conspiracy or mutual antipathy talks (Nazism, Sexism, Anti-Humanity, Ad Hominen, etc.) I don't consider discussions in such
a range worthy of words. They deserve only criticism. They exist just because some people lacking education need something to prove their 
attendance in politics and society. 

The political sensitivity here is a unique phenomenon in a society with strong censorship. Topics that deserve attention and rethinking are sometimes prohibited:
Why does a city fail to prevent and even acquiesce in the woman trade? What is the exact loss caused by red-guards, when people will get their deposit in rural banks here, or 
Why is the president so harsh and wants to keep his seat forever? The authorities hide the issues to maintain a positive image or so-called stability. 

At least, from my perspective, when someone talks about politics, "political sensitivity" works better 
in attracting an audience than the traditional qualities: accuracy, honesty, and persuasion. People, no matter their disdain, fear, or favour the "Politically sensitive" topics, 
do show more intensive reactions. 
Most rebellious audiences become energetic when a speaker leads into unseen and "dangerous" content.
In contrast, Prudent people show fear. They would say: "Stop talking! You might get in jail!"
And Conservatives will be angry and argue: "how dare you slander the country and party!

Authorities have granted the people little freedom of speech, even though now the constitution includes the rights. Chinese pay more 
than being hated for talking against "Big Brother": they pay with personal freedom, reputation scores, or even blood. 
Sensitive talking is considered either courage or disrespect. 

I won't criticize the speakers or audience for forbidden topics. They are brave, rebellious, and somehow respectful. What 
frustrates me is the existence of sensitivity itself. With the prohibition and mystery, the fact is hard to reach, conspiracy is hard 
to detect, and a calm and unbiased mind is hard to maintain.
