### Tightening Noose

During most of the time we observe the CCP(Chinese Communist Party), it is nearly impossible to read the supreme leaders and instutions' intents when
they release their movements, decisions, and opinions, offen seemed nonsense. They have the arrogance supported by their expanding
power, so that leading the country to a place suit their own benefit and value, without for a second concerning the collective good of 1.4 billion herds.

The power is strong. We observers are weak. I cannot walk in front of the Tian'Anmen Square to shout for suffering people: caution! tanks are overwhelming
the land! However, history is stronger, so as time. The superpower is doomed to collapse and the facts are promised to succeed. Therefore, I'm gonna take
record of events about CCP here, as a matter of unbiased reflection of history.

9.10/9.11 Li Zhanshu (2022, Chairman of the Standing Comittee of the Nation's People's Congress) visited Russia, expressed his support. The 
Chinese supreme controls seem to have kind of attachment to Russia propaganda. No one knows why. Maybe the purpose is to maintain a public image
of anti-NATO/USA, or just the foolish and stubborn favor to Soviet-Russia (Considering the majority of them was born in 50s and 60s, preferrence over
Slovaks are...reasonable?) 

Pro-Russia can bring severe damage on Chinese international reputation in a context where Russia is widely defined as evil invador. 
Following international collaborations on commerce, politics, or even millitary might be difficult to succeed. Confidence in China would furthur decline
 after zero-covid policies, investment would be driven down, Chinese would be considered alien, the rich would flee. (SOMETHING TO MENTION: XI MIGHT NOT BE
 ABLE TO RECOVER TAIWAN DURING HIS LIFETIME IN SUCH STINKING REPUTATION AMONG EUs AND NATOs, LOL----OBVIOULSY, PLA CAN BEAT TAIWAN TROOPS, BUT NOT NATOs, BRUH)
